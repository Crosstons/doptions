## Presentation Overview

### 1. Landing Slide
- *Project Name*
- *Introduction of Team*
- Duration: 5-10 seconds

### 2. What is dOptions?
- *Quick Overview*
- *Functions available to users*
- Duration: 15-20 seconds

### 3. Agent Cypher
- *Summary of the integration with dOptions and functions it performs, current scope of what it can do*
- *The goal behind the operations*
- Duration: 15-20 seconds

### 4. Dataset
- *The skeleton of the dataset, columns*
- *Preprocessing done: interpolation, MinMaxScaling*
- *Features used in the training*
- Duration: 30 seconds

### 5. Training
- *Model Used: XGBoost (binary: logistic)*
- *Usage of MCR for complexity reduction*
- *Accuracy of the model*
- Duration: 20-30 seconds

### 6. Future Scope / Roadmap
- *Total Automation: Implement end-to-end trade execution, currently it only buys options*
- *Enable the agent to write options for profits (the true power of dOptions which allows true decentralization by allowing anybody to write custom options)*
- *Introduce strategies like hedging and diversification*
- *Enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy through improved data processing*
- Duration: 30-40 seconds

### 7. Challenges Faced
- *First time working with XGBoost*
- *Complexity Reduction for on-chain proofs*
- *Integration of contract calls with agent*
- Duration: 10-20 seconds

### 8. Thank You
- *Praise Giza Stack (wonderful experience, looking forward to continue building, Giza has true potential to revolutionize zkML)*
- *We are open to questions*
- Duration: 5-10 seconds
